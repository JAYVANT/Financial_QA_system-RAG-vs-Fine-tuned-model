The announcement was a catalyst for our leadership team transformation in 2023 and into 2024. Mr. Schulmans longstanding leadership at PayPal made a positive and lasting impact, and the Board was committed to identifying a successor with extensive product, technology, and global payments experience who would build on Mr. Schulmans contributions and be a next-generation leader, capable of driving growth across the PayPal platform for years to come. Largely in connection with the appointment of Mr. Schulmans successor, we reconstituted our leadership team in late 2023 and early 2024, positioning PayPal for its next phase of growth. After a rigorous search process, Alex Chriss joined PayPal as President and CEO in September, followed by our new CFO, Jamie Miller, who joined in November. Mr. Chriss joined PayPal from Intuit and has extensive product, technology and global payments experience, which will enable him to drive growth across the PayPal platform for years to come. Ms. Miller was most recently Global CFO of EY and brings a proven track record of driving strong financial results and guiding both public and private companies through dynamic and meaningful transformation. Additionally, PayPal further strengthened its next-generation leadership team by hiring seasoned leaders across several key roles, including Michelle Gill, who joined to serve as PayPals Executive Vice President, General Manager of the newly formed Small Business & Financial Services Group; Diego Scotti, who joined as Executive Vice President, General Manager of our Consumer Group and Global Marketing & Communications; Isabel Cruz, who joined as Executive Vice President, Chief People Officer; and Suzan Kereere, who joined as President, Global Markets. These leadership appointments underscore PayPals commitment to building a high-performing organization, with the goal of advancing innovation and solutions to better serve our customers and in turn drive more profitable growth. 2024 Proxy Statement 3 PROXY STATEMENT PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY Our 2023 Key Highlights Sound Financial and Operational Performance In 2023, we delivered solid financial and operating results across our key performance metrics. This was accomplished during a period which saw the successful transition of multiple key leadership roles, accompanied by macroeconomic uncertainty, slowing e-commerce growth and continued geopolitical instability. We ended the year with 426 million active consumer and merchant accounts and $29.8 billion in revenue, an 8% increase compared to 2022. In 2023, we processed 25.0 billion payment transactions and $1.53 trillion in total payment volume across our platform, representing year-over-year increases of 12% and 13%, respectively. We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy, returning $5 billion to stockholders through share repurchases in 2023, representing 119% of our free cash flow. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to 40 billion of our eligible consumer installment receivables portfolio, including a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations, and sold $5.5 billion of loans receivable during the year in connection with this agreement. Additionally, we completed the divestiture of Happy Returns for $466 million in cash proceeds, enabling greater focus on our core business and strategic priorities. Our cost discipline efforts contributed to solid non-GAAP earnings pe",

As of December 31, 2022, we utilized externally published projections of the U.S. and U.K. forecasted unemployment rates, forecasted U.S. retail e-commerce sales, and forecasted U.K. household disposable income, among others, over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The overall principal and interest coverage ratio as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately 9% and 7%, respectively. A significant change in the forecasted macroeconomic factors could result in a material change in our allowances. Our allowance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 took into account uncertainty with respect to macroeconomic conditions, uncertainty around the financial health of our borrowers, and effectiveness of loan modificationprogramsmadeavailabletomerchants.Anincreaseof1% intheprincipalandinterestcoverageratiowould increaseourallowancesbyapproximately$60millionbasedontheloansandinterestreceivablebalanceoutstandingasof December31,2023. 2024AnnualReport 49 ANNUAL REPORT PARTII Item7.ManagementsDiscussionandAnalysisofFinancialConditionandResultsofOperations AccountingForIncomeTaxes Ourannualtaxrateisbasedonourincome,statutorytaxrates,andtaxplanningopportunitiesavailabletousinthevarious jurisdictions in which we operate.

Since then, Ive spent time with PayPals employees, customers, partners, and stockholders to learn about our greatest strengths, where we need to move faster, what we need to change, and how to instill a culture of innovation that returns PayPal to a position of strength. Im pleased with what weve been able to accomplish in such a short period of time to reposition PayPal for profitable growth. Weve put in place a world-class leadership team and organized the business around the customers we serve  consumers, small businesses, and enterprises. Weve narrowed our focus to the products and services that will have the greatest impact for our customers. And weve updated our mission to reflect the evolution of our purpose: revolutionizing commerce globally.

We aim to deliver a best-in-class personalized commerce experience, and drive engagement by creating a richer value proposition that makes PayPal the obvious choice for both consumers and businesses. All the investments and improvements we will make this year are guided by a set of new operating principles that we believe will help us drive value creation over time. The principles we will follow are: start with the customer; focus on profitable growth; drive operating leverage over time; set measurable goals and communicate consistently; and maintain a strong balance sheet. Were committed to increasing transparency and accountability, and investing in areas of our business that will drive profitable growth and margin expansion in the years ahead. However, it will take time for these new initiatives and operating model to produce results. 2024 is a transition year focused on execution and moving with velocity to put the organization on a path for long-term success. I know that were on the right strategic path that will allow this company to fully embrace the future that awaits us. I am grateful to our employees who have shown incredible resolve in solving our customers greatest challenges and who are working tirelessly to transform PayPal. To our stockholders, customers, and partners, thank you for your continued support and belief in what we can achieve together. Thank you. Alex Chriss President and CEO April 9, 2024 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Message from Our Independent Board Chair Dear PayPal Stockholders: 2023 was a pivotal year for PayPal as we welcomed Alex Chriss to our Company and to our Board. While steering the successful CEO search and transition, the Board worked closely with management to navigate a complex macroeconomic environment and deliver solid financial and operational results. Looking ahead, we are inspired by the energy and vision that the new leadership team brings to their roles, and we believe PayPal is well-positioned for future profitable growth. Executive Leadership Transitions One of the Boards key priorities in 2023 was to identify a next-generation leader capable of driving growth across the PayPal platform for years to come. After a rigorous search process, we were thrilled to find in Alex a seasoned executive steeped in technology and product leadership experience with an impressive and proven track record of growing businesses. We are also pleased to have appointed new executives to lead our Finance and People functions, as well as our Global Markets, Small Business & Financial Services and Consumer business units. Their collective expertise, honed through leadership roles at preeminent companies, will be crucial to our path forward. In overseeing these executive transitions, the Board has redoubled our commitment to building relationships with new leaders and ensuring that each of our leaders is cultivating robust talent development processes and succession plans. With this strong leadership team now in place, PayPal is ready to embark on our next chapter of growth and expansion. Board Composition & Oversight Collectively, our Boards balanced and diverse mix of skill sets, experiences and perspectives enables proper oversight of our business as we continue to evolve and grow in a rapidly shifting competitive environment. In particular, the Boards thoughtful approach to risk oversight supports our enterprise-wide global risk and compliance program to safeguard our customers and our platform, which is of the utmost importance. Our Board is committed to continuous improvement, and the annual Board and committee self-evaluations play a critical role in ensuring the continued effectiveness of our Board and each committee. Stakeholder Engagement Robust, ongoing engagement with our stockholders, customers, employees, regulators and other stakeholders is crucial to informing the Boards decision-making process. Since our 2023 Annual Meeting, weve contacted investors representing approximately 50% of our common stock and have engaged with investors holding approximately 19% of our common stock. As part of these efforts, independent directors met with investors representing approximately 12% of our common stock. These discussions covered a variety of subjects, including board composition and oversight, executive compensation and corporate sustainability and impact topics. Stockholders feedback provides the Board and management with invaluable perspectives, and we look forward to continuing this important dialogue with our stakeholders. On behalf of our Board, thank you for your investment in PayPal. I look forward to discussing these developments further with you at the 2024 Annual Meeting on May 22, which will be held via live webcast at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.comPYPL2024.

The announcement was a catalyst for our leadership team transformation in 2023 and into 2024. Mr. Schulmans longstanding leadership at PayPal made a positive and lasting impact, and the Board was committed to identifying a successor with extensive product, technology, and global payments experience who would build on Mr. Schulmans contributions and be a next-generation leader, capable of driving growth across the PayPal platform for years to come. Largely in connection with the appointment of Mr. Schulmans successor, we reconstituted our leadership team in late 2023 and early 2024, positioning PayPal for its next phase of growth. After a rigorous search process, Alex Chriss joined PayPal as President and CEO in September, followed by our new CFO, Jamie Miller, who joined in November. Mr. Chriss joined PayPal from Intuit and has extensive product, technology and global payments experience, which will enable him to drive growth across the PayPal platform for years to come. Ms. Miller was most recently Global CFO of EY and brings a proven track record of driving strong financial results and guiding both public and private companies through dynamic and meaningful transformation. Additionally, PayPal further strengthened its next-generation leadership team by hiring seasoned leaders across several key roles, including Michelle Gill, who joined to serve as PayPals Executive Vice President, General Manager of the newly formed Small Business & Financial Services Group; Diego Scotti, who joined as Executive Vice President, General Manager of our Consumer Group and Global Marketing & Communications; Isabel Cruz, who joined as Executive Vice President, Chief People Officer; and Suzan Kereere, who joined as President, Global Markets. These leadership appointments underscore PayPals commitment to building a high-performing organization, with the goal of advancing innovation and solutions to better serve our customers and in turn drive more profitable growth. 2024 Proxy Statement 3 PROXY STATEMENT PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY Our 2023 Key Highlights Sound Financial and Operational Performance In 2023, we delivered solid financial and operating results across our key performance metrics. This was accomplished during a period which saw the successful transition of multiple key leadership roles, accompanied by macroeconomic uncertainty, slowing e-commerce growth and continued geopolitical instability. We ended the year with 426 million active consumer and merchant accounts and $29.8 billion in revenue, an 8% increase compared to 2022. In 2023, we processed 25.0 billion payment transactions and $1.53 trillion in total payment volume across our platform, representing year-over-year increases of 12% and 13%, respectively. We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy, returning $5 billion to stockholders through share repurchases in 2023, representing 119% of our free cash flow. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to 40 billion of our eligible consumer installment receivables portfolio, including a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations, and sold $5.5 billion of loans receivable during the year in connection with this agreement. Additionally, we completed the divestiture of Happy Returns for $466 million in cash proceeds, enabling greater focus on our core business and strategic priorities. Our cost discipline efforts contributed to solid non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2023. This progress is a direct result of our sharpened focus, responsible innovation and enhanced cost discipline, which will enable us to execute against our core strategic priorities. Performance Highlights The following graphic summarizes key performance highlights for 2023. As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis below, in line with our pay-for-performance philosophy, a significant portion of executive compensation is tied to company performance. Notably, the 2023 PayPal Annual Incentive Plan featured both Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Margin as performance criteria and performance-based restricted stock units granted in 2023 vest in part based on a metric related to Free Cash Flow.

The financial results of these VIEs were included in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs was included as short-term investments of $87 million, loans and interest receivable, net of $21 million, and long-term debt of $98 million.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to provisions for transaction and credit losses, income taxes, loss contingencies, revenue recognition, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, and the valuation of strategic investments.

The announcement was a catalyst for our leadership team transformation in 2023 and into 2024. Mr. Schulmans longstanding leadership at PayPal made a positive and lasting impact, and the Board was committed to identifying a successor with extensive product, technology, and global payments experience who would build on Mr. Schulmans contributions and be a next-generation leader, capable of driving growth across the PayPal platform for years to come. Largely in connection with the appointment of Mr. Schulmans successor, we reconstituted our leadership team in late 2023 and early 2024, positioning PayPal for its next phase of growth. After a rigorous search process, Alex Chriss joined PayPal as President and CEO in September, followed by our new CFO, Jamie Miller, who joined in November. Mr. Chriss joined PayPal from Intuit and has extensive product, technology and global payments experience, which will enable him to drive growth across the PayPal platform for years to come.

This was accomplished during a period which saw the successful transition of multiple key leadership roles, accompanied by macroeconomic uncertainty, slowing e-commerce growth and continued geopolitical instability. We ended the year with 426 million active consumer and merchant accounts and $29.8 billion in revenue, an 8% increase compared to 2022. In 2023, we processed 25.0 billion payment transactions and $1.53 trillion in total payment volume across our platform, representing year-over-year increases of 12% and 13%, respectively. We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy, returning $5 billion to stockholders through share repurchases in 2023, representing 119% of our free cash flow. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to 40 billion of our eligible consumer installment receivables portfolio, including a forward-flow arrangement",

The announcement was a catalyst for our leadership team transformation in 2023 and into 2024. Mr. Schulmans longstanding leadership at PayPal made a positive and lasting impact, and the Board was committed to identifying a successor with extensive product, technology, and global payments experience who would build on Mr. Schulmans contributions and be a next-generation leader, capable of driving growth across the PayPal platform for years to come. Largely in connection with the appointment of Mr. Schulmans successor, we reconstituted our leadership team in late 2023 and early 2024, positioning PayPal for its next phase of growth.

This was accomplished during a period which saw the successful transition of multiple key leadership roles, accompanied by macroeconomic uncertainty, slowing e-commerce growth and continued geopolitical instability. We ended the year with 426 million active consumer and merchant accounts and $29.8 billion in revenue, an 8% increase compared to 2022. In 2023, we processed 25.0 billion payment transactions and $1.53 trillion in total payment volume across our platform, representing year-over-year increases of 12% and 13%, respectively.

We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy, returning $5 billion to stockholders through share repurchases in 2023, representing 119% of our free cash flow. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to 40 billion of our eligible consumer installment receivables portfolio, including a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations, and sold $5.5 billion of loans receivable during the year in connection with this agreement. Additionally, we completed the divestiture of Happy Returns for $466 million in cash proceeds, enabling greater focus on our core business and strategic priorities. Our cost discipline efforts contributed to solid non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2023. This progress is a direct result of our sharpened focus, responsible innovation and enhanced cost discipline, which will enable us to execute against our core strategic priorities.

The announcement was a catalyst for our leadership team transformation in 2023 and into 2024. Mr. Schulmans longstanding leadership at PayPal made a positive and lasting impact, and the Board was committed to identifying a successor with extensive product, technology, and global payments experience who would build on Mr. Schulmans contributions and be a next-generation leader, capable of driving growth across the PayPal platform for years to come. Largely in connection with the appointment of Mr. Schulmans successor, we reconstituted our leadership team in late 2023 and early 2024, positioning PayPal for its next phase of growth. After a rigorous search process, Alex Chriss joined PayPal as President and CEO in September, followed by our new CFO, Jamie Miller, who joined in November.

Ms. Miller was most recently Global CFO of EY and brings a proven track record of driving strong financial results and guiding both public and private companies through dynamic and meaningful transformation. Additionally, PayPal further strengthened its next-generation leadership team by hiring seasoned leaders across several key roles, including Michelle Gill, who joined to serve as PayPals Executive Vice President, General Manager of the newly formed Small Business & Financial Services Group; Diego Scotti, who joined as Executive Vice President, General Manager of our Consumer Group and Global Marketing & Communications; Isabel Cruz, who joined as Executive Vice President, Chief People Officer; and Suzan Kereere, who joined as President, Global Markets.

This was accomplished during a period which saw the successful transition of multiple key leadership roles, accompanied by macroeconomic uncertainty, slowing e-commerce growth and continued geopolitical instability. We ended the year with 426 million active consumer and merchant accounts and $29.8 billion in revenue, an 8% increase compared to 2022. In 2023, we processed 25.0 billion payment transactions and $1.53 trillion in total payment volume across our platform, representing year-over-year increases of 12% and 13%, respectively. We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy, returning $5 billion to stockholders through share repurchases in 2023, representing 119% of our free cash flow. In June 2023,",

We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy, returning $5 billion to stockholders through share repurchases in 2023, representing 119% of our free cash flow. In June 2023, we entered into a multi-year agreement with a global investment firm to sell up to 40 billion of our eligible consumer installment receivables portfolio, including a forward-flow arrangement for the sale of future originations, and sold $5.5 billion of loans receivable during the year in connection with this agreement. Additionally, we completed the divestiture of Happy Returns for $466 million in cash proceeds, enabling greater focus on our core business and strategic priorities. Our cost discipline efforts contributed to solid non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2023. This progress is a direct result of our sharpened focus, responsible innovation and enhanced cost discipline, which will enable us to execute against our core strategic priorities.
